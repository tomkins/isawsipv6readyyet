# Is AWS IPv6 ready yet?

A website to track AWS' support of IPv6 across all services, available at
[isawsipv6readyyet.com](https://isawsipv6readyyet.com/).

Our goal is to promote IPv6 support available in AWS, and to encourage them to improve so that
IPv6 is available in all services. The dream would be that this site is redundant as everything
can be run in AWS without public IPv4 addresses being required.

## Contributions

Feel free to open a GitHub issue or pull request.

Additional notes on support (or to document unexpected IPv6 behaviour) is welcome. Scoring is
opinionated - feel free to suggest (but we may so no).
